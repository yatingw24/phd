        <p>Several universities recently announced a suspension of doctoral admissions in response to the halt of federal funding to research institutions by roughly $4 millions.</p>
        <p>And this is not new - the effect of underpayment first ripples outwards with students in non-science and engineering where Boston University decided to halt doctoral applications in Humanities for the 2025-2026 admission cycle after the unionized strike to raise annual salary. The English Department at the University of Chicago now only opens the admission to those with a specialized interest in media aesthetics while other tracks of interest are shut down.</p>
        <p>Among all doctoral students, those in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences have struggled the most for the longest time with the lowest stipend that barely sustains the cost of living. </p>
        <p>While the stipend gap grows even bigger, the baseline of a hard-core science major was unreachable for students in Humanities in the first place. From 2015 to 2019, STEM candidates out-earned Humanities candidates by about $5000. </p>

        <p>The pandemic imposed more difficulties, doubling the financial pressure for PhD students. Most had to deal with an inflated workload with everything turned online, and students in non-traditional science majors even saw a drop in the rate. </p>
        <p>A PhD student’s income comes partially from teacher assistantship, but the TAship comes with much invisible pressure. Different from a professor who taught the class for several years, a doctoral student needs to familiarize himself with the material and learn how to teach from scratch. “Everything was new, and I was a student like everyone else who’s new to the class,” said Isa Li, a doctoral recipient in Anthropology at New York University in her final year. </p>
        <p>Li was lucky enough to receive compensation from teacher assistantship (TA) given that it is separated from the annual financial package. “But for other schools, compensation was not guaranteed if TAships were a part of the regular stipend,” she said.  </p>
        <p>Surprisingly, PhD students in Social Science, while technically qualified as STEM majors, are similarly underpaid. Even after an escalation post-covid, the rate for Social Science candidates can hardly catch up with candidates in hard-core Science majors. 
        </p>
        <p>Saving money is an unattainable goal for a PhD student if the stipend is his sole income source. Except PhD candidates in Business, the other three fields of study do not financially qualify for the median cost of living in the US, $3851 per month, in 2024. Easily, one’s stipend could be drained by simply paying the bill. Li is able to sustain herself with savings from her previous job and her partner’s support. “But if you are single or you came directly from your undergrad or grad, the financial burden can double,” Li said.  </p>
        <p>Everyone who contributes full-time labor deserves a livable wage, Professor Eric Weiskott, an English professor at Boston College, wrote in his <a href='https://www.chronicle.com/article/who-can-live-on-a-ph-d-stipend'>research</a> on English PhD stipends in the United States. Regardless of one’s discipline, one usually lives on or near campus, “but landlords do not adjust rent by discipline!” he added. </p>
        <p>Many candidates enter their programs already carrying student loans, and the disparity in graduate debt between Humanities and STEM PhD students is revealing. 30 to 50 percent of students in Social Science, Humanities and Arts undertake debt during their studies, while fewer than 20 percent of STEM students reported financial debt. </p>
